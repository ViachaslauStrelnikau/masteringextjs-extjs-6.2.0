# Packt

This is the test project from the book Loiane Groner - Mastering Ext JS, 2nd Edition - 2015.
Adapted to extJS 6. The main book and project have written on extJS 5.0.0, which is not 
fully compatible with extJS 6. I tried to fix most of the problem, so the the project starts
and run fine under GPL extJS 6.2.0 and Chrome browser v69.
